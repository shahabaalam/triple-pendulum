## Project Overview

This repository contains a comparative analysis of how different AI models interpret and implement the same physics simulation prompt: *"Create a triple pendulum animation that follows the laws of gravity. No controls, no interactions—just the motion. Each intercept leaves a trail. Built for clean visuals and maximum chaos: true gravitational dynamics, elegant trail rendering, zero UI distractions."*

Each HTML file represents a unique implementation generated by a different AI model, showcasing variations in physics calculations, visual styling, and implementation approaches.

## Model Comparison

| Model | File | Key Characteristics |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| **Claude Sonnet 4** | `claude_sonnet_4.html` | Clean dark theme, accurate physics equations, smooth trail rendering |
| **DeepSeek V3.1** | `deepseek_v3.1.html` | Simplified physics model, varying mass/length ratios, semi-transparent trails, responsive design |
| **Gemini 2.5** | `gemini2.5.html` | Complete physics with matrix calculations, equal pendulum parameters, timestamp display, clean implementation |
| **GPT-5** | `gpt5.html` | Verlet integration + distance constraints, dual canvas system, advanced trail fading, device pixel ratio aware |
| **Opus 4.1** | `opus4.1.html` | Gradient background, elegant color scheme, optimized performance |

## Features Implemented

All implementations include:
- ✅ **True gravitational dynamics** - Physics-based triple pendulum motion
- ✅ **Elegant trail rendering** - Visual trails that fade over time
- ✅ **Clean visuals** - Minimal UI with focus on the animation
- ✅ **Zero distractions** - No controls or interactive elements
- ✅ **Real-time timestamp** - Running timer for chaos observation

## Viewing Instructions

Simply open any of the HTML files in a modern web browser:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shahabaalam/triple-pendulum.git
cd triple-pendulum

# Open in browser (replace with your preferred browser)
open claude_sonnet_4.html
```

Or view directly in your browser by double-clicking any HTML file.

## Analysis Challenge

**Watch each animation to the end, then comment with the timestamp of the most chaotic swing you observe.**

The chaotic nature of triple pendulums means each model's slight implementation differences can lead to dramatically different long-term behaviors—a perfect demonstration of the butterfly effect in computational physics.
